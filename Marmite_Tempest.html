            <p>
                A kind person who after finds him self helping his friends get out of trouble. Despite the brave and confidentface he commonly puts on when doing so, he’s someone who worries alot and is scared deep down. His most striking trait is his cyborconitic arm, which is the source of his powers. Capable of absorbing, storing and releasing vast quantities of electricity, he’s a feaces fighter despite he’s small build. More importantly though, he’s able to use that electricity stored to travel though time into the future. Unfortunately, he’s unable to travel back in time however, as it was an experiment to do so that blasted him from the fabric of space time, leading him to crash into the Worldview Observatory. This event is what lead to what Worldview is today however.

            <ul>
                <li>The origins of Marmite go back to 2013, when I named a squid in Minecraft Marmite, I later would go on to use this name myself in Minecraft and other games.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The first version of Marmite as a character was my Inkling character in Splatoon 2. This is why he has many similarities to Inklings in his design and where the "ling" in his species name comes from.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Marmite's hand is able to be shot off from a cable in his arm, acting like a hook shot. This can be used for mobility, or grab far-away targets for precise electric attacks.</li>
                <br>
                <li>The way Marmite shoots out electricity is based on lightning generation from Avatar the Last Air Bender</li>
                <br>
                <li>Marmite's Blood is pink in color</li>
                <br>
                <li>While Elyss is able to sense the home dimension of almost anyone she meets, being ripped through space-time and violently arriving at Worldview unintentionally makes even sensing the multiversal cluster he’s from hazy.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Outside of Inklings, other inspirations for Marmite’s design are Geo and Deva from Gwain Saga, Zekrom from Pokemon, and Tari from Meta Runner. </li>
                <br>
                <li>The Symbol on the Zipper of his jacket is a reference to the Zohar from Xenosaga and the Trinity Processor from Xenoblade, which share the same share.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Marmite was created long before the idea of Worldview, in which he had tons of different lore that got changed frequently, some of these included;
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Full ability to travel freely in time, which angered a time deity.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li>Was part of a series of time travels that used different types of energy to time travel, originally having a single brother named Marmite Inferno with fire powers and being a red and white pallet swap. </li>
                         <br>
                         <li>There was a point where he was part of a series of 5, with the 3 other brothers that harnessing the powers of light, sound, and kinetic energy as well.</li>
                      </ul>    
                </li>
